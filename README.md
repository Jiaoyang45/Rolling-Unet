The official implementation of the paper ["Rolling-Unet: Revitalizing MLP’s Ability to Efficiently Extract Long-Distance Dependencies for Medical Image Segmentation"](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i4.28173) published in AAAI-2024.


## Introduction
Medical image segmentation methods based on deep learning network are mainly divided into CNN and Transformer. However, CNN struggles to capture long-distance dependencies, while Transformer suffers from high computational complexity and poor local feature learning. To efficiently extract and fuse local features and long-range dependencies, this paper proposes Rolling-Unet, which is a CNN model combined with MLP. Specifically, we propose the core R-MLP module, which is responsible for learning the long-distance dependency in a single direction of the whole image. By controlling and combining R-MLP modules in different directions, OR-MLP and DOR-MLP modules are formed to capture long-distance dependencies in multiple directions. Further, Lo2 block is proposed to encode both local context information and long-distance dependencies without excessive computational burden. Lo2 block has the same parameter size and computational complexity as a 3×3 convolution. The experimental results on four public datasets show that Rolling-Unet achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
